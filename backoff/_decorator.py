    """Returns decorator for backoff and retry triggered by predicate.

    Args:
        wait_gen: A generator yielding successive wait times in
            seconds.
        predicate: A function which when called on the return value of
            the target function will trigger backoff when considered
            truthily. If not specified, the default behavior is to
            backoff on falsey return values.
        max_tries: The maximum number of attempts to make before giving
            up. In the case of failure, the result of the last attempt
            will be returned. The default value of None means there
            is no limit to the number of tries. If a callable is passed,
            it will be evaluated at runtime and its return value used.
        max_time: The maximum total amount of time to try for before
            giving up. If this time expires, the result of the last
            attempt will be returned. If a callable is passed, it will
            be evaluated at runtime and its return value used.
        jitter: A function of the value yielded by wait_gen returning
            the actual time to wait. This distributes wait times
            stochastically in order to avoid timing collisions across
            concurrent clients. Wait times are jittered by default
            using the full_jitter function. Jittering may be disabled
            altogether by passing jitter=None.
        on_try: Callable (or iterable of callables) with a unary
            signature to be called before each attempt. The parameter
            is a dict containing details about the invocation.
        on_backoff: Callable (or iterable of callables) with a unary
            signature to be called in the event of a backoff. The
            parameter is a dict containing details about the invocation.
        on_giveup: Callable (or iterable of callables) with a unary
            signature to be called in the event that max_tries
            is exceeded.  The parameter is a dict containing details
            about the invocation.
        on_success: Callable (or iterable of callables) with a unary
            signature to be called in the event of success. The
            parameter is a dict containing details about the invocation.
        logger: Name of logger or Logger object to log to. Defaults to
            'backoff'.
        **wait_gen_kwargs: Any additional keyword args specified will be
            passed to wait_gen when it is initialized.  Any callable
            args will first be evaluated and their return values passed.
            This is useful for runtime configuration.
